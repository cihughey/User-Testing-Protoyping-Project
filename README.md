# User-Testing-Protoyping-Project
Exercised Balsamiq wire-framing to develop a mobile application high-fidelity prototype that allows students with mobile disabilities to navigate their way around Georgia Techâ€™s campus more effectively.
Conducted research through user testing interviews for feedback on design interaction, system vs real world functionality, flexibility, and efficiency of use to consider further improvements for the final mobile application high-fidelity prototype.
